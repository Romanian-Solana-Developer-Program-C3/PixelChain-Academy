  <h1>PixelChain Academy</h1>
  <p>
    <strong>PixelChain Academy</strong> is a <em>2D browser-based pixel-art adventure</em> that turns blockchain concepts into an interactive learning journey.
  </p>

  <h2>🔗 Sign-in Flow</h2>
  <p>
    Players connect their Solana wallet (<code>Phantom</code>, <code>Solflare</code>, etc.) via a secure Firebase-backed “Sign in with Solana” flow.
  </p>

  <h2>🚜 Farm Adventure</h2>
  <p>
    Once inside, your pixel-art avatar becomes a farmer on a vibrant farm map, working the fields to uncover and master blockchain fundamentals:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Blocks &amp; Transactions</li>
    <li>Smart Contracts</li>
    <li>Nonces &amp; Gas Fees</li>
    <li>NFT Metadata</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🎯 Learning Challenges</h2>
  <p>
    Along the way, you’ll tackle bite-sized learning challenges—quizzes, interactive tutorials, and consensus puzzles—embedded directly into the farm.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Quizzes to test your knowledge</li>
    <li>Interactive on-chain tutorials</li>
    <li>Consensus puzzles to solidify concepts</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🏅 Rewards via NFT Minting</h2>
  <p>
    Completing a challenge triggers an Anchor program on Solana Devnet to mint a unique cosmetic NFT (farm outfits, badges, or tools) via Metaplex CPI. These NFTs appear in your connected wallet and unlock special in-game visuals or abilities, turning your new skills into tangible rewards.
